# AI Parking Management System — Backend

NestJS backend API for the AI Parking Management System.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

By default the server listens on `${PORT:-3000}`.

## Validation + authentication

- Global request validation is enabled via Nest's `ValidationPipe` (see `src/main.ts`).
- Some endpoints are protected with JWT via `JwtAuthGuard`.
- JWT secret comes from `JWT_SECRET` (falls back to `dev_secret_change_me` for local development).

## Routes

This section documents the routes currently implemented by the controllers under `src/core/**/controller/*.controller.ts`.

### Auth (`/auth`)

| Method | Path | Auth? | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Public | Register a new user. |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Public | Login and receive a JWT (and/or auth payload as implemented in the service). |

Request bodies:

- `POST /auth/register`: `RegisterDto` (`src/core/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`)
- `POST /auth/login`: `LoginDto` (`src/core/auth/dto/login.dto.ts`)

### Parking lots (`/parking-lots`)

| Method | Path | Auth? | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| GET | `/parking-lots/search?lat=...&lng=...&radiusKm=...` | Public | Search parking lots near a coordinate. `radiusKm` defaults to `3`. |
| GET | `/parking-lots/:id` | Public | Get details for a specific parking lot. |
| GET | `/parking-lots/owner/mine` | JWT | Get parking lots owned by the current user. |
| POST | `/parking-lots` | JWT | Create a new parking lot (owner). |
| PATCH | `/parking-lots/:id` | JWT | Update a parking lot (owner). |
| POST | `/parking-lots/:id/working-hours` | JWT | Set/update working hours for a parking lot. |
| POST | `/parking-lots/:id/pricing` | JWT | Set/update pricing for a parking lot. |

Notes:

- Protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Create/update DTOs live in `src/core/parking-lots/dto/`.
